## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
 ground_clearance and vehicle_length provided non-random amount of variance to the mpg valuesin the dataset, and vehicle_weight also probably provided some variance, but not at a significant level. 
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Our p-value came out to 5.35e-11, making it smaller than a 0.05 significance level. Therefore, we believe the slope has a non-zero value. 
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
With a multiple r-squared value of 0.7149, we predict the model will know the mpg of Mechacar prototypes 71.49 percent of the time. This not an extremely effective model at only 71% but it should be enough to do a decent job.
